# weBudget - Frontend 


## The Details:

This app is built using a Rails API backend and React JS frontend.


### Frontend: React/Redux
This front end is built with React and Redux. My front end makes fetch requests to my Rails API. For example, the table displayed on the DOM displays a users expenses fetched from the API and stores that data in localStorage['current_user']. I do this so that the table can display the data again on page refreshes. 

### Getting Started:

* Clone the repository

#### Set up the front end

* cd into the frontend folder
```
* npm install
```

#### View the front end

* npm start
