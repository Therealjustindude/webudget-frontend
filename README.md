# weBudget - Frontend 
This app was created to help keep track of your monthly expenses.

## The Details:

To get the back end up and running visit: https://github.com/Therealjustindude/webudget-backend .

This app is built using a Rails API backend and React JS frontend. If you seeded the db you can sign in as test user. Instructions below in set up.


### Frontend: React/Redux
This front end is built with React and Redux. My front end makes fetch requests to my Rails API. For example, the table displayed on the DOM displays a users expenses fetched from the API and stores that data in localStorage['current_user']. I do this so that the table can display the data again on page refreshes.
